- Big Swing is 20% PA instead of 25%
- Blighted fists should work in brawls now
- Blood mage now reduces health by 2 per level instead of 20% overall (which was affecting enchantments)
- Blood warrior now gives +50 health instead of +100, I was gaslighted into making it +100. You literally gain a positive buff by lvl 10-20 depending on what race you picked. Not to mention, it frees up slots for raising magicka/stamina.

- Dovah Tinvaak is now 20% more often at 30% reduced effectiveness

- Fencer is now 30% LA instead of 25%. Big Swing and Fencer now no longer accidently buff/nerf bows
- Gambler now gives 30% crit chance to make it a bit less broken in the early game. There are also a lot of ways to gain crits now
- Iron Knees movement is 15% reduction now
- Light foot is now 10% speed boost. Gives it better synergy with Lurker, Rage and other traits
- Lurker effect gives 1.5 health and stamina instead of 2 health

- Master of destiny reverted back to 5 skill boost, still 5 perk points
- Pacifist instead of not being applicable to atronachs they get 2 health/stamina instead of 2 magicka/stamina
- Quester now only counts each quest once (e.g. 1 type of missive) and only works on non-misc quests. However, it gives 2 stats per quest. 
- Silent Dovah is now 2 souls per buff. Speech and intimidation checks almost always fail.
- Soul Reaver is now 15% enchantment boost but 20% weapon/armor reduction
- True Apprentice now is 60% spell cost reduction, but changed the 60% to be "fortify" instead of perk-based so it doesn't stack with other fortify types to bypass the reduction cap.
- Witcher buffed to 30% stronger potions and 3x ingredients. The 4 potion limit was way too limiting. This should make Witcher more interesting to play as a preparation build.

##***Vampire Changes***

- Potions of Viscera are no longer craftable.
- All vampires can craft elixer of blood potions with half efficiency. Being a vampire lord and taking the courts chef perk doubles the amount you receive or makes them twice as cheap.
- 4 strange meat/human flesh to make 1 without perk, 2 with perk.
- Human hearts require 2 for 1 without perk, 1 for 1 with perk.
- The new Cursed Daedric hearts as well as CC lich hearts can be used. Gives 2 per 1, 4 with the perk.
- Vampire fish can be used in place of vampire dust for potions of hunger.

##***Smithing and Passive Changes/Bugfixes***

- All "Quicksilver" Weapons/Armors renamed back to Nordic
- All Fortify Smithing enchantments changed to Fortify Reflect enchantments (reflect % physical damage). Unique artifacts may still have smithing enchant.
- Upgrade kits no longer require wood to make. Because that makes no sense to me. They also last for 3600 seconds instead of 1800.
- Fixed LoreBox mistakes/missing entries
- Fixed several armor keywords to make them actually do things (mostly CC stuff)
- Ebony Mail can now be swapped between Light and Heavy variants at the forge with Legendary Blacksmithing. Also adds proper Ebony keyword to Ebony Mail.
- Cloth padding now provides 100 armor rating if wearing no armor, 75 if wearing light and 50 if wearing heavy.

- Craftsmanship Tier 2 Removed. All bonuses now get unlocked with the first tier.
- Dwarven Weapons now Absorb 5 magicka instead of damaging 20 magicka.
- Tempering Craftsmanship 1.5 --> 1.3
- Tempering Dwarven/Advanced Light Smithing/Advanced 1.6 --> 1.35
- Tempering Elven/Orcish Smithing 1.7 --> 1.4
- Tempering Daedric/Draconic Smithing/Legendary 2.0 --> 1.5
- Tempering Ebony/Glass Smithing 1.9 --> 1.45

- Some armor passives changed (per piece). Mostly to equalize light/heavy variants:
- Blackguard/Thieves Guild 10% Sneak

- Madness 4% ally damage
- Dark Seducer/Golden Saint +3/2% Speech/Magic Res

- Guard/Hide +10/10% Stamina/Stamina Regen
- Iron/Remnant 3.5% Fire/Shock Res
- Netch/Akaviri 3% Movement
- Nightingale/Ancient Shrouded 2% Movement Speed/Magic Res
- Bonemold/Leather 7% Shock Res - Fur 7% Frost Res
- Linwe's/Shrouded 25%/20% less stamina when moving while sneaking
- Orcish +6 Stamina/Armor Rating
- Scale 3% Magic Res
- Falmer 15% Poison Res
- Forsworn 7% Alteration Cost
- Wolf 1% Movement Speed/Damage Reflection
- Ancient Nordic 2.5% Shour CDR
- Imperial/Steel/Stormcloak +5 Health
- Vigilant Corrupted 10% Silver Res
- Silverhand 10.5% Werewolf Res
- Silver 8% Undear/Werwolf Res
- Penitus 5% illusion cost
- Vampire 20% Stronger Vampiric Drain

- New Smithing level requirements. This makes lvl 35 Daedric/Draconic possible with smart use of Oghma.
- T1: 10 (Craftsmanship) 
- T2: 30 (Advanced, Dwarven, Advanced Light)
- T3: 50 (Elven/Orcish/Arcane)
 - T5: 70 (Ebony/Glass)
- T6: 90 (Daedric/Draconic/Legendary)

##***Alchemy and Food Changes***

- Added "Cursed Daedra Hearts". These have powerful alchemy effects, even compared to regular daedra hearts. However, they cannot be used for smithing. Killing a Daedra now usually yields a cursed heart (since LoreRim has so many damn new daedra). Hand-placed hearts from Requiem are unaffected. Most mod-placed hearts are replaced by Cursed Daedra hearts.
- Healing poultices are weaker and shorter duration but now work in combat and have a higher AOE for companions. Same applies with linen bandages.
- Damage magicka/stamina potions suck, nobody uses these. Now they do 1/4 of the magicka or stamina damage to health as well.
- Fortify Jump potions also nullify fall damage
- Fairies (which already drop unique ingredients) now also drop soul gems. Also removed most exterior fairies.
- Skooma reworked. Now 30% damage instead of 50% and 400 stamina instead of 500. However, positive benefits last 50% longer. Also, negative detriments after skooma wears off last MUCH MUCH longer and stamina/magicka are damaged by 100.
- Alcohol reworked. Alcohol levels based on value. Instead of providing just health, alcohol provides armor rating with 1/4 of that as health. Should make alcohol feel more unique in its buff. E.G. +100 alcohol = 100 AR + 25 HP
- Alcohol duration based on alcohol type. Ales/meads = 300/450. Wines = 600/900. Spirits = 900/1350.
- All alcohol weighs .5 now instead of some being 1. Water/milk/waterskins now weigh 0.1
- Inebriation amount is 3/4 of alcohol amount.
- Juices and Glacier water now also hydrate. Hydration now lasts 1800 seconds.

##***Shout Changes***

- Storm Call now is an aimed shout that does health/stamina damage over 12 seconds, twice as much to constructs. At rank 2-3 it also gives the classic Storm Call effect, giving it more utility. Storm call no longer targets allies.
- Plague Breath damage doubled but recovery time increased by 50%


##***General Changes***

- Added crafting recipes for nearly every scroll and staff in LoreRim thanks to BardicNoel
- Exhaustion penalties are now based on stamina percentage being less than 10% instead of stamina being less than 10.
- Sinding SIGNIFICANTLY buffed to make the Savior's Hide a proper endgame item. He now has more health, more stamina, more damage resist, less weak to poison that regular werewolves, 30% magic resist and a powerful health regen that only stops while under the effects of harmful poison.
- Buffed Baan Maluur creatures
- Some areas (particularly starter dungeons near riverwood/whiterun) have had enemy spawns slightly lowered. 
- The Cause is now much harder and the lich isn't a pushover
- Vendors take longer to respawn
- Bleakfalls Barrow 1 handed katana is now in the first chest. The first chest also has more chance to have potions and scrolls but no gems/gold

- Added better conditions to sanguine so that buffs are more consistent
- Hermaeus Black Books halved in effect (kinda insane that they're permanent). Also the spell cost reduction is now 5% stronger spells.
- Magnus completely reworked to be thematic to staves. His follower ability is gives 30% stronger spells and 50% less charge use when holding a staff. Still no magicka regen. No penalties for Atronachs.

***

- Rueful Axe now absorbs 20 health/magicka/stamina

***

- Blighted fists should work in brawls now
- Blood mage now reduces health by 2 per level instead of 20% overall (which was affecting enchantments)
- Blood warrior now gives +50 health instead of +100, I was gaslighted into making it +100. You literally gain a positive buff by lvl 10-20 depending on what race you picked. Not to mention, it frees up slots for raising magicka/stamina.

- Gambler now gives 30% crit chance to make it a bit less broken in the early game. There are also a lot of ways to gain crits now

- Quester now only counts each quest once (e.g. 1 type of missive) and only works on non-misc quests. However, it gives 2 stats per quest. 
- Silent Dovah is now 2 souls per buff. Speech and intimidation checks almost always fail.
- Soul Reaver is now 15% enchantment boost but 20% weapon/armor reduction
- True Apprentice now is 60% spell cost reduction, but changed the 60% to be "fortify" instead of perk-based so it doesn't stack with other fortify types to bypass the reduction cap.
- Witcher buffed to 30% stronger potions and 3x ingredients. The 4 potion limit was way too limiting. This should make Witcher more interesting to play as a preparation build.

***

### Vampire Changes

- Unearthly Will buff is now 20% stronger spells instead.

***

### Smithing and Passive Changes/Bugfixes

- Skyforge Steel weapons are now their own material type. Passively, they do 10% more poise damage. 
- All Fortify Smithing enchantments changed to Fortify Reflect enchantments (reflect % physical damage). Unique artifacts may still have smithing enchant.
- Upgrade kits no longer require wood to make. Because that makes no sense to me. They also last for 3600 seconds instead of 1800.
- Fixed LoreBox mistakes/missing entries
- Fixed several armor keywords to make them actually do things (mostly CC stuff)
- Ebony Mail can now be swapped between Light and Heavy variants at the forge with Legendary Blacksmithing. Also adds proper Ebony keyword to Ebony Mail.
- Cloth padding now provides 100 armor rating if wearing no armor, 75 if wearing light and 50 if wearing heavy.

- Craftsmanship Tier 2 Removed. All bonuses now get unlocked with the first tier.
- Dwarven Weapons now Absorb 5 magicka instead of damaging 20 magicka.

- T3: 50 (Elven/Orcish/Arcane)
- T5: 70 (Ebony/Glass)
- T6: 90 (Daedric/Draconic/Legendary)

***

### Alchemy and Food Changes

- Added "Cursed Daedra Hearts". These have powerful alchemy effects, even compared to regular daedra hearts. However, they cannot be used for smithing. Killing a Daedra now usually yields a cursed heart (since LoreRim has so many damn new daedra). Hand-placed hearts from Requiem are unaffected. Most mod-placed hearts are replaced by Cursed Daedra hearts.
- Healing poultices are weaker and shorter duration but now work in combat and have a higher AOE for companions. Same applies with linen bandages.
- Damage magicka/stamina potions suck, nobody uses these. Now they do 1/4 of the magicka or stamina damage to health as well.
- Fortify Jump potions also nullify fall damage
- Fairies (which already drop unique ingredients) now also drop soul gems. Also removed most exterior fairies.
- Skooma reworked. Now 30% damage instead of 50% and 400 stamina instead of 500. However, positive benefits last 50% longer. Also, negative detriments after skooma wears off last MUCH MUCH longer and stamina/magicka are damaged by 100.
- Alcohol reworked. Alcohol levels based on value. Instead of providing just health, alcohol provides armor rating with 1/4 of that as health. Should make alcohol feel more unique in its buff. E.G. +100 alcohol = 100 AR + 25 HP
- Alcohol duration based on alcohol type. Ales/meads = 300/450. Wines = 600/900. Spirits = 900/1350.
- All alcohol weighs .5 now instead of some being 1. Water/milk/waterskins now weigh 0.1
- Inebriation amount is 3/4 of alcohol amount.
- Juices and Glacier water now also hydrate. Hydration now lasts 1800 seconds.

***

### Shout Changes

- Storm Call now is an aimed shout that does health/stamina damage over 12 seconds, twice as much to constructs. At rank 2-3 it also gives the classic Storm Call effect, giving it more utility. Storm call no longer targets allies.
- Plague Breath damage doubled but recovery time increased by 50%

***

### Magic Changes

- Magicka is broken in Requiem. I don't mind people becoming powerful, but I did some testing and, with the right setup, was able to cast Master-level spells that had a base cost of 4,000 and 1HKO's every enemy for just 200 magicka. These changes should alleviate that.
- Almost all instances of perk-entry based "mod spell cost multiply value" are gone. Now, most of the remaining spell cost reductions contribute to the 80% cap. TLDR "spell cost reduction" modifiers that were setup incorrectly caused people to be able to overcap.
- Ward Mastery is unaffected by this change. Unskilled Spellcasting and Novice thru Master Skill perks are unaffected.
- Vaermina, Syrabane and Julianos are unaffected. Bretons and Altmer are unaffected. Mystic Binding is unaffected.
- With few exceptions, most cost reduction perks in the skill trees are 0.9x (but usually are now higher magnitudes)
- Shalidor's insights now give 200% power AND duration of spells instead of 150% power OR duration and 50% cost.
- Battlemage Heavy Armor perk no longer provides a spell reduction buff, because that makes 0 sense than heavy armor would cast for cheaper than light armor. Now they get 10% stronger or longer lasting spells.
- Agile spellcasting now has a second rank which gives 10% stronger or longer lasting spells when wearing light armor.
- Black Book F&F Magicka now 25% stronger spells on top of 50 magicka regen to make it on par with the stamina book.
- Black Book F&F Stamina now has a proper description showing 25% damage and 50 stamina regen.
- Black Book F&F Half Damage now actually reduces ALL incoming spell damage by 50% instead of just destruction spells.
- Black Book: The Sallow Regent Seeker of Sorcery is now 10% stronger or longer lasting spells
- Mystic Empowerment is now 2x bound weapon duration but 0.9x cost.
- All-Maker Stone: Tree. Now is 50% stronger spells for the duration.
- Battlemage class skill is now 15% stronger spells on top of power attack reduction.
- Mage class skill is now 5% stronger spells.
- Staff Channeling is now 10/20% stronger spells while holding a staff but no cost reduction.
- I've literally never even considered taking Metamagic. 50% cost increase is insanely steep for 20% power. Now the cost increase is just 30%.
- Removed "jump ahead" system that magic redone adds. With this, you could cast the spells in a higher tier for 75% of the cost. For example, if you picked novice destruction you cast novice spells at 50% but you could also cast apprentice spells for 75%.
- Tier perks (novice/apprentice/etc) now taper inversely instead of all reducing cost by 50%. Now Novice perk brings total cost to 40%, Apprentice 45%, Adept 50%, Expert 55%, Master 60%. This gives slightly more reason to use lower tier spells.
- Spell scaling has been equalized across all tiers. Before, Master spells would get stronger based on skill level compared to Novice spells. Now, all tiers scale as much as apprentice across all levels. 

***

### General Changes

- Added crafting recipes for nearly every scroll and staff in LoreRim thanks to BardicNoel
- Exhaustion penalties are now based on stamina percentage being less than 10% instead of stamina being less than 10.
- Sinding SIGNIFICANTLY buffed to make the Savior's Hide a proper endgame item. He now has more health, more stamina, more damage resist, less weak to poison that regular werewolves, 30% magic resist and a powerful health regen that only stops while under the effects of harmful poison.
- Buffed Baan Maluur creatures
- Some areas (particularly starter dungeons near riverwood/whiterun) have had enemy spawns slightly lowered. 
- The Cause is now much harder and the lich isn't a pushover
- Vendors take longer to respawn
- Bleakfalls Barrow 1 handed katana is now in the first chest. The first chest also has more chance to have potions and scrolls but no gems/gold

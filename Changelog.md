# Changelog

** >>>>> CHANGELOG FOR V2.2.10 <<<<< **

**Added:**

@gonzeh COTN Falkreath retexture. Should fix warping in interiors. LODs won't fully match until I re-run dyndolod but it's close enough.

Kanjs - Ebony Blade

Kanjs - Arms of Chaos

Multilayer Parallax Animated Dawnbreaker



**Updated:**

Nordic Northern Roads

LoreRim Bestiary

Alchemical Appraisal Services

Ultimate NPC dodging

Spell Perk Item Distributor to V 7.1.3 since outfits are no longer distributed through SPID

Orcish Armor Retexture

Sanctified Stolen Goods

Patreons Menu

DVA - Dynamic Vampire Appearance

Feeding Perk Notification

Temper and Recharge Services

Obscure Magic

Fists of Fury 



**Changes:**

Changed almost all Speech perks to be more descriptive of what effect they actually have.

Increased follower carry weight by 25.

Added name to Movarth Piquine (before it was a random name)

Buffed Movarth's Boots. They are now the same appearance as Vampire boots and give 40% sneak buff instead of just 10%. 

War Axe/Battleaxe bleed no longer applies on people who are blocking, undead or dwarven constructs. 



**Bugfixes:**

Weapon placement in Mehrune's Shrine for one of the Lost Relics

Fixed dagger sneak from behind dmg as well as weapon keyword

Removed all quest triggers from CC alternative armor quests. Even if you somehow find the notes, it should no longer trigger the quests.

Fixed some navmesh around Amber Guard
